## üíæ Data Layer

The application uses a type-safe data layer built with MongoDB and TypeScript. The data layer is organized into the following components:

### Operations

- **Create:** `CreateOperations<T extends BaseDocument>`
- **Read:** `ReadOperations<T extends BaseDocument>`
- **Update:** `UpdateOperations<T extends BaseDocument>`
- **Delete:** `DeleteOperations<T extends BaseDocument>`

## Loading States

The application implements progressive loading states using Next.js's built-in loading UI feature. Each page has a corresponding `loading.tsx` file that shows a loading state while the page content is being fetched.

This approach provides a better user experience by:

- Showing static content immediately
- Using shimmer effects to indicate loading states
- Maintaining layout stability during loading
- Reducing perceived loading time

For more information about loading states in Next.js, see the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading).

## Error Handling

The application implements a robust error handling system using Next.js 13+ error handling features:

### Global Error Page

- Located at `app/error.tsx`
- Handles runtime errors in the application
- Provides user-friendly error messages
- Includes "Try Again" and "Go back home" options
- Logs errors to console (can be extended to error reporting services)

### Not Found Page

- Located at `app/not-found.tsx`
- Handles 404 errors for non-existent routes
- Consistent styling with error page
- Clear navigation back to homepage

### API Error Handling

- All API routes include try-catch blocks
- Standardized error response format:
  ```typescript
  {
    error: string;
    message: string;
  }
  ```
- HTTP status codes for different error types:
  - 400: Bad Request
  - 401: Unauthorized
  - 403: Forbidden
  - 404: Not Found
  - 500: Internal Server Error

### Error Handling Best Practices

1. **Server Components**: Errors in server components are caught by the nearest error boundary
2. **Client Components**: Use try-catch blocks for client-side error handling
3. **API Routes**: Implement proper error handling and status codes
4. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for compile-time error prevention
5. **Error Logging**: Console logging for development, can be extended to production logging services

For more information about Next.js error handling, refer to the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/error-handling).
